# Scouting agency application

The "Scouting Agency" application provides proper functioning of the scouting system within a football club. Almost all professional football clubs today have a network of employed scouts tasked with watching matches, tracking players, and taking notes on their characteristics. The network of scouts is coordinated by a superior figure - the sporting director, responsible for adding new scouts and scheduling matches necessary for viewing. This application precisely ensures quality presentation of the database within a scouting network, as well as quality coordination and distribution of tasks among scouts. Scouts and the sporting director are indeed two different types of application users. The application provides the ability to change the theme and language, which are remembered for the next user login.
